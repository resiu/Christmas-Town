# MUS205-Final-Project
An interactive Christmas scene where users can explore and interact with various houses in the town. Clicking on a house transports the user into an animated living room filled with interactive Christmas elements.

First Draft: So far we have the interactive image for our first scene where when you click on the door it'll bring you to the next scene -- the living room. We accomplished this by making a color detecting function where when your mouse is over the specific brown of the door (which we edited the image to ensure the doors would be a solid brown color unique to the doors) and click, it'll move you to the next scene.

In addition we added clouds to the scene and we are currently implementing a 'click-to-snow' feature to the clouds.
Accomplished through adding a Cloud class.

We have also started to add our audio files which we will implement soon.

As for the living room, we had to manually re-size and extend the image as it wasn't horrizontal enough so we did that manually by drawing in the background on a third party app.
